# ** Todo list - The Odin Project **

In this assignment I am required to create a todo manager using Javascript, CSS and HTML. The design is inspired by Todoist.

The program allows to create todos assigning a priority level and due date, create projects and filter todos by project.

I feel like this project would benefit from the use of a database. After the addition of local storage, filters do not work properly, but the rework of the data storage would fix this issue.

I also think the structure of the project can be greatly improved. I want to get back to this project in the future.
